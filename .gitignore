# /: The trailing slash means that __pycache__ is a directory.
# Without the slash, __pycache__ would match both files and directories with that name.

# With the slash, only directories with the name __pycache__ are ignored.
# a plain name like `__pycache__` or `.idea` tells GitHub to
# ignore that directory located in the same directory as the `.gitignore` file.

# `/example.txt` to ignore a file named `example.txt` in the root of your repository.
# `subdirectory/*.txt` to ignore all `.txt` files in the subdirectory folder.
# `**/example.txt` to ignore all `example.txt` files in any directory in the project.
